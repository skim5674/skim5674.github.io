I’m a **battery cell engineer** specializing in **silicon-anode systems, cell testing, and electrochemical analysis**.

My experience spans academic research on low-temperature batteries (Purdue), industrial NPI work (Rivian), and cell testing + optimization for Si-based anodes (Alkegen).

At Alkegen, I design and operate **end-to-end testing workflows** — from coin/SLP assembly and testing protocols to SQL/Python/Tableau pipelines for real-time analytics.


**Core Interests**
- Electrochemical analysis for battery-cell development
- DOE-driven cell-performance optimization
- Data infrastructure & visualization for battery cell testing labs
