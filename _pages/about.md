I’m a **battery cell engineer** specializing in **silicon-anode systems, cell testing, and electrochemical analysis**.

My experience spans academic research on low-temperature batteries (Purdue), industrial NPI work (Rivian), and cell testing + optimization for Si-based anodes (Alkegen).

In my current position at Alkegen, I design and operate **end-to-end testing workflows** — from coin/SLP assembly and testing protocols to SQL/Python/Tableau pipelines for real-time analytics.

   
**Core Interests**
- Electrochemical analysis for battery-cell development
- DOE-driven cell-performance optimization
- Data infrastructure & visualization for battery cell testing labs


**Technical Expertise**
- Testing Systems: Arbin, Neware, Maccor, BaSyTec, Toyo, BioLogic, Gamry  
- Data & Automation: Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI  
- Electrochemical Analysis: EIS, dQ/dV, dV/dQ, GITT, PITT  
- Hands-on Cell Development: Coin & SLP (two/three-electrode), cylindrical cell teardown  
- Materials Characterization: SEM, XRD, Raman, FTIR, DSC, TGA, XPS  
- Other Tools: Origin, 3ds Max, KeyShot
