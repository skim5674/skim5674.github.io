## 🧩 Project 1 — Automated Cell Testing Data Pipeline
*(Python · SQL · Tableau · Arbin/Neware)*  

**Objective:**  
Build a unified SQL-based database and automated workflow for daily cell-testing data aggregation.  

**Approach:** 
<div style="margin-top:-0.5em">
- Designed Python scripts to extract I–V, cycle, and EIS data from battery testers  
- Developed SQL Server tables for Tableau / Power BI visualization  
- Built Tableau dashboards for KPIs (capacity retention, ICE, impedance growth)  

</div>

**Impact:**  
💡 Reduced manual data-processing time > 90 %; enabled real-time performance tracking and full test traceability.

## 🔋 Project 2 — Facility Expansion for Single-Layer Pouch (SLP) Cell Testing
*(Equipment setup · SOP writing · Test optimization)*  

**Objective:**  
Establish repeatable, high-yield SLP builds for Si–graphite anodes.  

**Contributions:**  
- Installed and configured new Arbin 96-channel testers + environmental chambers  
- Set up SLP assembly equipment  
- Authored and standardized SLP assembly SOPs  
- Designed formation & cycling protocols reducing variability  

**Result:**  
✅ Successfully introduced new equipment and SLP workflow to the team.

## 🚗 Project 3 — Current-Violation Risk Assessment (Rivian Intern)
*(High-frequency current testing · Teardown · Analysis)*  

**Objective:**  
Characterize high-frequency current-ripple impact on battery cells.  

**Contributions:**  
- Set up hardware for current-ripple tests  
- Conducted 2170-cell teardowns and three-electrode tests for risk evaluation  
- Designed protocols usable for current/future EV-cell programs  
- Supported new equipment acquisition to expand capability  

**Result:**  
✅ Published operational limits based on data and secured approval for equipment upgrade.
